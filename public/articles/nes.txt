Bringing pixelart UI into the Browser w/ NES.css
5/21/20
NES.css

Github Repo
Developed out of a not-so-uncommon distaste for standard css tropes, NES.css's developer B.C.Rikko finished paving their path to mainstream recognition with the release of v1.0.0. After recieving a github star from kazuya kawaguchi on the 15ths of November 2018, the repository skyrocketed to 1000 stars in exactly 14 days, earning B.C.Rikko their first GitHub Trending Developer award. By January of 2019 NES.css had won over 10,000 stars & reached 5th place on the GitHub css-framework topic. Offering a robust feature-set, NES.css came complete with NES pixel art stylings for:

Text Areas & Fields
Push & Radio Buttons
Checkboxes
Inputs
Dropdowns
Containers
Dialogs
Lists
Tables
Progress Bars
Avatars
Speech Bubbles w/ Sprite Faces
Cursors
Badges
Reactions
Social & Commercial Icons
The whole package came with a smattering of Nintendo-brand pixel prites & fully realized dark themes across the board for each styling. A live demo can be found here and I'll see you next time on CSS Gems
