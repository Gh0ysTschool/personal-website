    overview
    Survey the galaxy to expand your Empire! Will you colonize nearby planets or take them by force? 
    Produce resources for trade and research new technologies to build the best empire and win the game!
    Eminent Domain is an empire building game in which your empire’s abilities are based on a deck of Role cards. At the beginning of the game each player has the same deck of cards. Every turn you must choose a role to execute and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck. When executing a role, you may Boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the role you have chosen. For example,the more research done by your empire, the better your empire gets at doing research - because there will be more research cards in your deck! During the game players gain influence throughout the universe by expanding their empire, doing research, and trading. You’ll Survey to find planets, Colonize them or use Warfare to incorporate them into your empire (flip them over) and gain access to their abilities and influence, Produce resources on the flipped planets to Trade, and study these planets to Research new technologies. The player whose empire has the most
    influence at the end of the game will rule the galaxy!
    Setup
    • Deal each player 1 Politics card. Remove any unused Politics cards from the game.
    • Separate the other Role cards by type and put them face up in 5 Stacks on their respective spaces on the central card display. These are the Role Stacks
    • Each player shuffles the following cards together to make a 10 card starting deck: 
    • 1 Politics card.
    • 1 Warfare card.
    • 2 Colonize cards.
    • 2 Research cards. 
    • 2 Survey cards. 
    • 2 Produce/Trade cards.
    • Randomly deal each player a Start Planet tile which they put FACE DOWN (survey side showing) in their Empire. Remove unused Start Planets from the game.
    • Shuffle the Planet cards and place them in a face down draw deck on the side of the central card display.
    • Randomly deal 1 Player Aid tile to each player. Whoever receives the Player Aid with “Start Player” on the back will play first. Remove unused Player Aids from the game.
    • 8 Influence tokens are marked differently than the rest. Set those aside leaving 24 in the supply.
    • Separate the Technology cards by type (Fertile Advanced Metallic ) into three FACE UP piles placed to one side of the central card display. These piles are freely accessible to all players at all times.
    • Draw 5 cards from your deck and you’re ready
    LEARNING GAME to begin!
    Some players can be overwhelmed by the
    number of Technology cards when learning the
    game. For your first game you might consider
    using the Learning Game described in the
    Variants section to help teach the game.
    6 7
    • In clockwise order, each opponent has the option to either Dissent or Follow the role:
    • Dissent: Draw 1 card from their deck to their hand.
    • Follow: Play cards from their hand bearing symbols matching the chosen role
    and execute the role effect (not the Leader bonus). Symbols on face up planets in
    their Empire may also be used to Follow the role. Note that you can Follow a role
    without playing any cards from your hand, using only symbols in your Empire.
    The base Hand Limit is
    5 cards, though it can be
    modified by planets in
    your Empire.
    3. Cleanup Phase (mandatory)
    Discard played cards and reconcile your hand.
    • Each player places cards they played during the Role Phase (except those
    tucked under planets as Colonies) into their respective discard piles.
    • You may discard any number of cards from your hand, keeping the rest.
    • Draw or discard cards until you reach your Hand Limit.
    • You only reconcile your hand during your own Cleanup Phase, never on an opponent’s turn.
    Whenever you must draw a card and your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck.
    Discard piles are open information and may be examined at any time.
    A role may still be chosen
    when its stack is empty.
    In that case, Trade,
    Produce, and Research
    have an additional
    Leader bonus. That bonus
    only applies when the
    stack is empty!
    Turns
    Player turns proceed clockwise. During your turn, you’ll complete the following 3 phases in order:
    1. Action Phase (optional)
    2. Role Phase (mandatory)
    3. Cleanup Phase (mandatory)
    1. Action Phase (optional)
    Play one card from your hand and resolve its Action effect.
    • Actions cannot be Boosted or Followed.
    • You may choose to play no Action and skip the Action Phase.
    After executing the Action, place the card played into your discard pile.
    2. Role Phase (mandatory)
    Lead one of the 6 roles: Colonize, Research, Produce, Trade, Survey, or Warfare, and resolve its Role effect.
    • Choose a Role from the Central Display.
    • Take a card from that Stack (if available) and place it in your play area.
    • You may Boost the chosen role by playing any number of cards from your hand with symbols matching
    that role. Symbols on face up planets in your Empire may also be used to Boost the Role. Cards played
    during the Action Phase do not contribute to Boosting the Role.
    • Resolve the Role effect, including the Leader bonus, taking into account all symbols used to Boost the
    role.

    Game End
    GAME GAME END TRIGGER
    2 player standard 1 stack depleted
    3 player standard 1 stack depleted
    3 player extended * 2 stacks depleted
    4 player standard 2 stacks depleted
    * See VARIANTS for Extended 3-player game variant.
    The game end is triggered when EITHER the Influence
    supply OR a number of Role card Stacks are exhausted.
    After this occurs, the game will end as soon as all
    players have taken an equal number of turns. The player
    sitting on the start player’s right will therefore take the
    last turn of the game.
    If the Influence supply runs out, players still receive
    Influence tokens they are entitled to – use the 8 set aside
    Influence tokens and spare Resource or Fighter tokens if
    need be.
    Determining the Winner
    Add the Influence from your Influence tokens, Technology cards and face up Planet cards to determine your
    score. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the most Resource and
    Fighter tokens in their Empire is the winner. In case of a further tie, play another game to determine the victor!
    Variants
    Learning Game
    It can be overwhelming to take in all of the Technology cards while trying to learn the game. Some players
    may prefer to play with this Learning Game variant to make it easier to understand how to play. Remove
    the Technology cards from the game, as well as the 3 Advanced planets with Research symbols. Turn the
    Research role Stack face down; it will not be used. The Learning Game is played exactly the same as the
    regular game, but without the Research role.
    To further ease into the game, you may choose to add only the Level 1 Technologies in your second game,
    leaving the Level 2 and Level 3 Technologies for after you see how the Research role works.
    Extended 3-Player Game
    For those who prefer a longer 3-player game, this variant will increase the game length. Remove 2 of each
    Role card (only 1 Warfare) from the Stacks during Setup. Play until the Influence supply or ANY TWO Role
    Stacks are exhausted.
    Planet CARDS
    • Each symbol on a face up planet in your Empire counts when resolving a role effect matching that symbol.
    • Resource slots store resources during the game. The slot indicates the type of resource it stores.
    Some planets have in their Game Effect area. This indicates that your Hand Limit
    is increased by 1.
    ROLE CARDS
    Politics
    Action:
    • Remove the Politics card from the game. Choose 1 Role card from
    the Stacks and add it to your hand
    • Politics cards are never used to Boost or Follow any Roles

    Survey
    Action:
    • Draw 2 cards from your deck to your hand.
    Role:
    • Look at one fewer Planet cards than the number of played.
    Examine the front and back of those card(s), and choose 1 to add
    (face down) to your Empire. Place the Planet cards that were not
    chosen in a face up planet discard pile.
    • If the Planet deck is empty, shuffle the planet discards to create a
    new planet deck.
    Leader Bonus:
    • Look at 1 additional Planet card.
    Warfare
    Action (Choose only 1):
    • Collect 1 Fighter token (it doesn’t matter which one) and place it in
    your Empire.
    • Attack 1 Planet: Return X Fighter tokens from your Empire to the
    supply (it doesn’t matter which ones) and flip over 1 planet in your
    Empire. “X” is shown as the Warfare cost on the Planet card.
    Role:
    • Collect 1 Fighter token for each Warfare symbol played.
    Leader Bonus:
    • Attack 1 Planet instead of collecting fighters: Return X Fighter
    tokens to the supply and flip over 1 planet in your Empire. “X” is
    shown as the Warfare cost on the Planet card.
    Important Notes:
    • Face up planets show some number of Influence points – this is
    the Influence value of the planet for end game scoring. DO NOT take Influence tokens from the supply
    when flipping a planet face up!
    • Players may only Attack face down planets in their own Empire.
    • Players may not Attack when Following a Warfare Role.
    • When Attacking a planet, place any Colonies on that planet into your discard pile.
    Colonize
    Action (Choose only 1):
    • +1 Colony: Tuck the Colonize card underneath the planet with
    Colonize symbols showing so all players can see the number of
    Colonies on the planet.
    • Settle 1 Planet: If a planet has sufficient Colonies, flip it over. The
    number of Colonies required is indicated on the Planet card. Place
    all Colonies from that planet into your discard pile.
    Role:
    • +1 Colony per : Tuck all cards played under any number
    of face down planets in your Empire. Colonize symbols on those
    cards count as Colonies on that planet.
    Leader Bonus:
    • Settle 1 planet instead of adding Colonies: If a planet has sufficient
    Colonies, flip it over. The number of Colonies required is indicated on the Planet card. Place all Colonies
    from that planet into your discard pile.
    Important Notes:
    • Face up planets show some number of Influence points – this is the Influence value of the planet for end
    game scoring. DO NOT take Influence tokens from the supply when flipping a planet face up!
    • It is legal to add more Colonies to a planet than the number required to Settle it.
    • Planets cannot be Settled when Following a Colonize role.
    Each Colonize symbol in your Empire reduces the number of Colonies needed to Settle a Planet
    by 1. You can think of these symbols as virtual Colonies on each planet in your Empire when
    you are trying to Settle.

    into play. The other side is ignored for the
    remainder of the game.
    • Level 2 and Level 3 Technology cards have
    Influence points printed on them. This is the Influence value of the card for end game scoring. DO NOT
